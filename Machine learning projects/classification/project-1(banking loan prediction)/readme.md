#  Loan Approval Prediction App

A web-based machine learning application built using **Flask** and **HTML** to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on user input. This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model via a simple web interface.

##  Features

- Collects user input through a responsive HTML form
- Predicts loan approval using a trained machine learning model
- Flask handles backend logic and model inference
- Displays prediction result instantly on the same page
- Easily extendable to support model retraining or database logging
